## year end 2019

This being the first post and year-end message is indicative of how my year has been. I've been jumping between projects deciding what my focus will be. I don't think I'll be contributing much more to [Remacs](https://github.com/remacs/remacs); it's a cool project but doesn't push my career forward in terms of research or the end product. Also, this year I learned I'm not a game developer. I get so caught up in tools like the [sheep texture packer](https://github.com/amethyst/sheep) that I can hardly make forward progress.

On a more positive note, I'm getting back into Android.
[Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) has promised to make UI development on Android more bearable, and my professional experience is all JVM/Android anyway, so here we go.
I'm also very interested in UI development in general, especially reactive/declarative UIs.
I'll be watching the work of [Raph Levien](https://raphlinus.github.io) and the [xi-editor/druid](https://github.com/xi-editor/druid) project and hopefully making my own contributions.
Working on Android doesn't mean I'm abandoning Rust, either.
druid is a Rust framework, and Rust has potential for a great cross-platform story (vs C++, for example).

All in all I'm looking forward to doing more open source contributions and polishing my existing projects in 2020.
